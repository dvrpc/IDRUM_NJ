To access all diversion routes within the state of New Jersey, please visit the [NJ Traffic Incident Management website](https://www.njtim.org/NJTIM/) and click on the [NJ Interactive Diversion Route Portal](https://www.njtim.org/NJTIM/NJDetour/DetourIndex).

DVRPC in partnership with PennDOT District 6, has developed the web-based Interactive Detour Route Mapping (IDRuM) application. It organizes all existing PennDOT and NJDOT Emergency Detour Routes within the Southeastern Pennsylvania and Southern NJ region into a manageable, easy-to-use interface. DVRPC has worked with PennDOT District 6 and NJDOT to update and reformat the detour route maps for all limited access highways within the region, replacing outdated paper maps with digital PDF maps. IDRuM compiles the PDF detour maps into a simple, "point-and-click" application. The detour route PDFs can be used by first responders, planners, and/or anyone who is in need of DOT-approved detour route plans.
